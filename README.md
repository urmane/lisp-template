# lisp-template
A template so I can remember what's needed to build a standalone lisp executable.

This is a tiny little set of files that I'm building up as I (re)learn lisp.  I'm using common lisp SBCL on OSX and Gentoo Linux, and this template currently tries to capture:

- Using ASD for system definitions
- Using packages and best practices for package files
- Using Roswell to create a script that uses the same files for interpreted runs

Clearly it needs work, so appreciate any comments, or additional best practices.
